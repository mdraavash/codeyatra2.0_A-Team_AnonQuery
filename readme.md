This is the github repo for Saral-Shikshya: A Smarter Education Solution 
This solution is presented to solve problems such as:
1. Class Interactions are minimal : Student have minimm interaction in class. This solution is introduced to provide an app where student are able to raise their question directly to their corresponding subject teachers. Here, each student shall be anonymous such that their is not shame in any types of question; small or big. This ensures that all student confusions are heard.
2. Teacher Evaluations : Student are able to rate the teachers answer for each question. This ensures that teacher also plays an active role in interaction between students and answers of teachers are valid and within context.
